/**
 * Adds contextual links associated with a view display to a renderable array.
 *
 * This function should be called when a view is being rendered in a particular
 * location and you want to attach the appropriate contextual links (e.g.,
 * links for editing the view) to it.
 *
 * The function operates by checking the view's display plugin to see if it has
 * defined any contextual links that are intended to be displayed in the
 * requested location; if so, it attaches them. The contextual links intended
 * for a particular location are defined by the 'contextual links' and
 * 'contextual_links_locations' properties in the plugin annotation; as a
 * result, these hook implementations have full control over where and how
 * contextual links are rendered for each display.
 *
 * In addition to attaching the contextual links to the passed-in array (via
 * the standard #contextual_links property), this function also attaches
 * additional information via the #views_contextual_links_info property. This
 * stores an array whose keys are the names of each module that provided
 * views-related contextual links (same as the keys of the #contextual_links
 * array itself) and whose values are themselves arrays whose keys ('location',
 * 'view_name', and 'view_display_id') store the location, name of the view,
 * and display ID that were passed in to this function. This allows you to
 * access information about the contextual links and how they were generated in
 * a variety of contexts where you might be manipulating the renderable array
 * later on (for example, alter hooks which run later during the same page
 * request).
 *
 * @param $render_element
 *   The renderable array to which contextual links will be added. This array
 *   should be suitable for passing in to drupal_render() and will normally
 *   contain a representation of the view display whose contextual links are
 *   being requested.
 * @param $location
 *   The location in which the calling function intends to render the view and
 *   its contextual links. The core system supports three options for this
 *   parameter:
 *   - 'block': Used when rendering a block which contains a view. This
 *     retrieves any contextual links intended to be attached to the block
 *     itself.
 *   - 'page': Used when rendering the main content of a page which contains a
 *     view. This retrieves any contextual links intended to be attached to the
 *     page itself (for example, links which are displayed directly next to the
 *     page title).
 *   - 'view': Used when rendering the view itself, in any context. This
 *     retrieves any contextual links intended to be attached directly to the
 *     view.
 *   If you are rendering a view and its contextual links in another location,
 *   you can pass in a different value for this parameter. However, you will
 *   also need to set 'contextual_links_locations' in your plugin annotation to
 *   indicate which view displays support having their contextual links
 *   rendered in the location you have defined.
 * @param string $display_id
 *   The ID of the display within $view whose contextual links will be added.
 * @param array $view_element
 *   The render array of the view. It should contain the following properties:
 *     - #view_id: The ID of the view.
 *     - #view_display_show_admin_links: A boolean whether the admin links
 *       should be shown.
 *     - #view_display_plugin_id: The plugin ID of the display.
