/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to display a node.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - node: Full node entity.
 *   - id: The node ID
 *   - bundle: The type of the node, for example, "page" or "article".
 *   - authorid: The user ID of the node author.
 *   - createdtime: Formatted creation date. Preprocess functions can reformat it by
 *     calling format_date() with the desired parameters on
 *     $variables['node']->getCreatedTime().
 *   - promoted: Whether the node is promoted to the front page.
 *   - sticky: Whether the node is 'sticky'. Sticky nodes are ordered above
 *     other non-sticky nodes in teaser listings
 *   - published: Whether the node is published.
 * - label: The title of the node.
 * - content: All node items. Use {{ content }} to print them all,
 *   or print a subset such as {{ content.field_example }}. Use
 *   {{ content|without('field_example') %} to temporarily suppress the printing
 *   of a given child element.
 * - user_picture: The node author's picture from user-picture.html.twig.
 * - date: Formatted creation date. Preprocess functions can reformat it by
 *   calling format_date() with the desired parameters on
 *   $variables['created'].
 * - name: Themed username of node author output from theme_username().
 * - node_url: Direct URL of the current node.
 * - display_submitted: Whether submission information should be displayed.
 * - submitted: Submission information created from name and date during
 *   template_preprocess_node().
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 *   The attributes.class element may contain one or more of the following
 *   classes:
 *   - node: The current template type (also known as a "theming hook").
 *   - node-[type]: The current node type. For example, if the node is a
 *     "Article" it would result in "node-article". Note that the machine
 *     name will often be in a short form of the human readable label.
 *   - view-mode-[view_mode]: The View Mode of the node; for example, a teaser
 *     would result in: "view-mode-teaser", and full: "view-mode-full".
 *   - preview: Whether a node is in preview mode.
 *   The following are controlled through the node publishing options.
 *   - promoted: Appears on nodes promoted to the front page.
 *   - sticky: Appears on nodes ordered above other non-sticky nodes in teaser
 *     listings.
 *   - unpublished: Appears on unpublished nodes visible only to site admins.
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - view_mode: View mode; for example, "teaser" or "full".
 * - teaser: Flag for the teaser state. Will be true if view_mode is 'teaser'.
 * - page: Flag for the full page state. Will be true if view_mode is 'full'.
 * - readmore: Flag for more state. Will be true if the teaser content of the
 *   node cannot hold the main body content.
 * - is_front: Flag for front. Will be true when presented on the front page.
 * - logged_in: Flag for authenticated user status. Will be true when the
 *   current user is a logged-in member.
 * - is_admin: Flag for admin user status. Will be true when the current user
 *   is an administrator.
 *
 * In field variables, each field instance attached to the node a corresponding
 * variable is defined; for example, 'node.body' becomes 'body'. When needing to
 * access a field's raw values, developers/themers are strongly encouraged to
 * use these variables. Otherwise they will have to explicitly specify the
 * desired field language; for example, 'node.body.en', thus overriding any
 * language negotiation rule that may have been applied previously.
 *
 * @see template_preprocess_node()
 *
 * @todo Remove the id attribute (or make it a class), because if that gets
 *   rendered twice on a page this is invalid CSS for example: two lists
 *   in different view modes.
 *
 * @ingroup themeable
