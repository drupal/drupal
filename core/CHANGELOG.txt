Drupal 8.4.0, 2017-10-04
------------------------
### Drush users: Update to Drush 8.1.12

[Versions of Drush earlier than 8.1.12 will not work with Drupal
8.4.x](https://www.drupal.org/node/2874827). Update Drush to 8.1.12 or higher
**before using it to update to Drupal core 8.4.x** or you will encounter fatal
errors that prevent updates from running. (Drush 8.1.12 and 8.1.13 will
successfully update Drupal 8.3.x to 8.4.0, but users may still see
[other error messages after updates have
run](https://www.drupal.org/node/2907224).)

### Updated browser requirements: Internet Explorer 9 and 10 no longer supported

In April 2017, Microsoft discontinued all support for Internet Explorer 9 and
10. Therefore, [Drupal 8.4 has as well](https://www.drupal.org/node/2842298).
Drupal 8.4 still mostly works in these browser versions, but bugs that affect
them only will no longer be fixed, and existing workarounds for them will
be removed beginning in Drupal 8.5.

Additionally, Drupal 8's [browser requirements documentation
page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/system-requirements/browser-requirements)
currently lists incorrect information regarding very outdated browser versions
such as Safari 5 and Firefox 5. [Clarifications to the browser policy and
documentation](https://www.drupal.org/node/2390621) are underway.

### Known Issues

Drupal 8.4.0-alpha1 includes major version updates for two dependencies:
Symfony 3.2 and jQuery 3. Both updates may introduce backwards compatibility
issues for some sites or modules, so test carefully. For more information, see
the "Third-party library updates" section below. Known issues related to the
Symfony update include:
  * [Incompatibility with Drush 8.1.11 and earlier](https://www.drupal.org/node/2874827).
  * [Other error messages with Drush 8.1.12 and higher](https://www.drupal.org/node/2907224).
  * [Certain file uploads may fail
    silently](https://www.drupal.org/node/2906030) due to a Symfony 3 backwards
    compatibility break if they used the `$deep` parameter (which was already
    deprecated in Symfony 2.8 and is removed in Symfony 3.0. *Check any custom
    file upload code* that may have used the deprecated parameter and [update
    it according to the API change record](https://www.drupal.org/node/2743809).

### Important fixes since 8.3.x

Translators should take note of several [string additions and changes since the
last release](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&issue_tags_op=%3D&issue_tags=String+change+in+8.4.0).

#### File usage tracking

Drupal 8 has several longstanding [file usage tracking
bugs](https://www.drupal.org/node/2821423). To prevent further data loss,
Drupal 8.4 has [disabled the automatic deletion of files with no known
remaining usages](https://www.drupal.org/node/2801777). This will result of the
accumulation of unused files on sites, but ensures that files erroneously
reporting 0 usages are not deleted while in use. Additionally, an issue with
[validation errors when saving content referencing these
files](https://www.drupal.org/node/2896480) has also been resolved.

[The change record explains how sites can opt back into marking files
temporary](https://www.drupal.org/node/2891902). If you choose to enable the
setting, you can also set "Delete orphaned files" to "Never" on
`/admin/config/media/file-system` to avoid permanent deletion of the affected
files.

While the files will no longer be deleted by default, file usage is still not
tracked correctly in several scenarios, regardless of the setting. Discussion
on [how to evolve the file usage tracking
system](https://www.drupal.org/node/2821423) is underway.

#### Configuration export sorting

* [#2361539: Config export key order is not predictable for sequences, add
  orderby property to config schema](https://www.drupal.org/node/2361539)
  resolves an issue where sequences in configuration were not sorted unless
  the code responsible for saving configuration explicitly performed a sort.
  This resulted in unpredictable changes in configuration ordering and
  confusing diffs even when nothing had changed. To resolve this issue, we've
  [added an `orderby` key to the config schema](https://www.drupal.org/node/2852566)
  that allows it to be sorted either by key or by value. Adding a preferred
  sort is strongly recommended.
* Two related issues remain open:
    * [#2860531: Add orderby key to third-party
      settings](https://www.drupal.org/node/2860531) relates to unsorted
      sequences which result in unexpected discrepancies in configuration
      during a configuration import.
    * [#2885368: Config export key order for sequences: "orderedby" does not
      support cases where the order actually
      matters](https://www.drupal.org/node/2885368) relates to various
      sequences in core and contributed modules in which the source order is
      important.

#### Revision data integrity fixes

* Previously, data from draft revisions for
  [path aliases](https://www.drupal.org/node/2856363),
  [menus](https://www.drupal.org/node/2858434),
  and [books](https://www.drupal.org/node/2858431) could leak into the live
  site. Drupal 8.4.0-alpha1 hotfixes all three issues by preventing changes to
  this data from being saved on any revision that is not the default revision.
  These fixes improve revision support for both  stable features and the
  experimental Content Moderation module.
* Correspondingly, [Content Moderation now avoids such scenarios with
  non-default revisions](https://www.drupal.org/node/2883868) by setting the
  'default revision' flag earlier.
* Previously, [saving a revision of an entity translation could cause draft
  revisions to go "missing"](https://www.drupal.org/node/2766957). Drupal 8.4.0
  prevents this by preventing the moderation state from being set to anything
  that would make the revision go "missing". Going forward, the entity system
  will also [provide the 'revision_translation_affected' base field by default
  for all revisionable and translatable entity
  types](https://www.drupal.org/node/2896845) for tracking such revisions.
* [A similar but unrelated bug in
  Content Moderation](https://www.drupal.org/node/2862988) has also been fixed
  in this release.

#### Other critical improvements

* When nodes were deleted, Menu UI module deleted their menu items. However,
  menu items may exist even whenm Menu UI module is not enabled and can also be
  attached to entities other than nodes. Therefore, menu item cleanup on entity
  deletetion [is now performed by the Custom Menu Links
  module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2350797) instead, covering the previously
  missing cases. A related issue that [broke module uninstallation for some
  modules providing menu items for certain entity
  forms](https://www.drupal.org/node/2907654) has also been resolved.
* A race condition occured in the Batch API when using fastcgi. The Batch API
  now ensures that [the current batch state is written completely to the
  database before starting the next
  batch](https://www.drupal.org/node/2851111).
* When uninstalling modules, empty fields were left behind to be purged.
  However, without the field definitions from the module, it was not possible
  to purge them any more. [Empty field deletion is now performed
  immediately](https://www.drupal.org/node/2884202) instead to avoid this
  scenario.
* When clearing caches in a translated interface, the field labels would
  [return to the default language](https://www.drupal.org/node/2650434).

### New stable modules

The following modules, previously considered experimental, are now stable and
safe for use on production sites, with full backwards compatibility and upgrade
paths from 8.4.0 to future releases:

#### Datetime Range

The [Datetime Range module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2893128) provides a
field type that allows end dates to support contributed modules like
[Calendar](https://www.drupal.org/project/calendar). This stable release is
backwards-compatible with the 8.3.x experimental version and shares a
consistent API with other Datetime fields.

Future releases may improve Views support, usability, Datetime Range field
validation, and REST support. For bugs or feature requests for this module,
[see the core Datetime issue
queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&status%5B%5D=Open&version%5B%5D=8.x&component%5B%5D=datetime.module&issue_tags_op=%3D).

#### Layout Discovery

The [Layout Discovery module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2834025) provides
an API for modules or themes to register layouts as well as five common
layouts. Providing this API in core enables core and contributed layout
solutions to be compatible with each other. This stable release is
backwards-compatible with the 8.3.x experimental version and introduces
[support for per-region attributes](https://www.drupal.org/node/2885877).

#### Media

The new core [Media module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2831274) provides an
API for reusable media entities and references. It is based on the contributed
[Media Entity module](https://www.drupal.org/project/media_entity).

Since there is a rich ecosystem of Drupal contributed modules built on Media
Entity, the top priority for this release is to [provide a stable core API and
data model](https://www.drupal.org/node/2895059) for a smoother transition for
these modules. Developers and expert site builders can now add Media as a
dependency. Work is underway to [provide an update path for existing sites'
Media Entity data](https://www.drupal.org/node/2880334) and to [port existing
contributed modules to the improved core
API](https://www.drupal.org/node/2860796). Both versions cannot be used at the
same time, so we also [prevent the 1.x version of the contributed Media Entity
module from being enabled at the same time as the core Media
module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2896427).

Note that **the core Media module is currently marked hidden** and will not
appear on the 'Extend' (module administration) page. (Enabling a contributed
module that depends on the core Media module will also enable Media
automatically.) The module will be displayed to site builders normally once
user experience issues with it are resolved. Similarly, the REST API and
normalizations for Media is not final and support for decoupled applications
will also be improved in a future release.

#### Inline Form Errors

The [Inline Form Errors module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2897652) provides a
summary of any validation errors at the top of a form and places the individual
error messages next to the form elements themselves. This helps users
understand which entries need to be fixed, and how. Inline Form Errors was
provided as an experimental module from Drupal 8.0.0 on, but it is now stable
and polished enough for production use. See the core [Inline Form Errors module
issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?text=&status=Open&priorities=All&categories=All&version=All&component=inline_form_errors.module)
for outstanding issues.

#### Workflows

The Workflows module provides an abstract system of states (like Draft,
Archived, and Published) and transitions between them. Workflows can be used by
modules that implement non-publishing workflows (such as for users or products)
as well as content publishing workflows.

Drupal 8.4 introduces a final significant backwards compatibility and data
model break for this module, [moving responsibility for workflow states and
transitions from the Workflow entity to the Workflow type
plugin](https://www.drupal.org/node/2849827). Read [Workflow type plugins are
now responsible for state and transition
schema](https://www.drupal.org/node/2897706) for full details on the API and
data model changes related to this fix. Now that this change is complete, [the
Workflows module became stable](https://www.drupal.org/node/2897130)!

While the module can be installed as-is, it is not useful in itself without
either Content Moderation and/or some other module that requires it.

### Content authoring and site administration improvements

* The "Save and keep (un)published" dropbutton has been replaced with [a
  "Published" checkbox and single "Save"
  button](https://www.drupal.org/node/2068063). The "Save and..." dropbutton
  was a new design in Drupal 8, but users found it confusing, so we have
  restored a design that is more similar to the user interface for Drupal 7 and
  earlier.
* Previously, deleting a field on a content type would also delete any views
  depending on the field. While the confirmation form did indicate that the
  view would be deleted, users did not expect the behavior and often missed the
  message, leading to data loss. [Now, the view is disabled
  instead](https://www.drupal.org/node/2468045). In the future, we intend to
  [notify users that configuration has been
  disabled](https://www.drupal.org/node/2832558) (as in this fix) as well as
  [give users clearer warnings for other highly destructive
  operations](https://www.drupal.org/node/2773205).
* The [Drupal toolbar no longer flickers](https://www.drupal.org/node/2542050)
  during page rendering, thus improving perceived front-end performance.
* Options in [timezones selector are now grouped by
  regions](https://www.drupal.org/node/2847651) and labeled by cities instead
  of timezone names, making it much easier for users to find and select the
  specific timezone they need.
* Both the ["Comments" administration page at
  `/admin/content/comment`](https://www.drupal.org/node/1986606) and the
  ["Recent log messages" report provided by
  dblog](https://www.drupal.org/node/2015149) are now configurable views. The
  "Comments" administration page also [has some default filters
  added](https://www.drupal.org/node/2898344).
* Useful meta information about a node's status is typically displayed at the
  top of the node sidebar. Previously, this meta information was provided by
  the Seven theme, so it was not available in other administrative themes.
  [This meta information is now provided by node.module
  itself](https://www.drupal.org/node/2803875) so other administration themes
  can access it.
* [Views now supports rendering computed
  fields](https://www.drupal.org/node/2852067).

### REST and API-first improvements

* Authenticated REST API performance increased by 15% by [utilizing the Dynamic
  Page Cache](https://www.drupal.org/node/2827797).
* POSTing entities [can now happen at `/node`, `/taxonomy/term` and so
  on](https://www.drupal.org/node/2293697), instead of `/entity/node`,
 `/entity/taxonomy_term`. Instead of confusingly different URLs, they therefore
  now use the URLs you'd expect. Backwards compatibility is maintained.
* There is now a dedicated resource for [resetting a user's
 password](https://www.drupal.org/node/2847708).
* Time fields now are [normalized to RFC3339 timestamps by
  default](https://www.drupal.org/node/2768651), fixing time ambiguity.
  Existing sites continue to receive UNIX timestamps, but can opt in. [See the
  change record for more information about backwards compatibility and on how
  to opt in](https://www.drupal.org/node/2859657).
* [Path alias fields are now normalized as
  well](https://www.drupal.org/node/2846554). [See the change record for
  information about how this impacts API-first modules and other features
  relying on serialized entities](https://www.drupal.org/node/2856220).
* When denormalization fails, a [422 response is now
  returned](https://www.drupal.org/node/2827084) instead of a 400, per the HTTP
  specification.
* With CORS enabled to allow origins besides the site's own host, [submitting
  forms was broken](https://www.drupal.org/node/2853201) unless the site's own
  host was also explicitly allowed. This is now resolved.
* Fatal errors and exceptions [now show a
  backtrace](https://www.drupal.org/node/2853300) for all non-HTML requests as
  well as HTML requests, which makes for easier debugging and better bug
  reports.
* Massive expansion of test coverage.

### Performance and scalability improvements

* Drupal 8 caches at various different levels for more effective caching.
  However, this resulted in exessively growing cache tables with tens or
  hundreds of thousands of entries, and gigabytes in size. [A new limit of 5000
  rows per cache bin was introduced to limit this
  growth](https://www.drupal.org/node/2526150).
* The internal page cache now [has a dedicated cache
  bin](https://www.drupal.org/node/2889603) distinct from the rest of the
  render cache for improved scalability.
* The service collector pattern instantiates all services it collects, which is
  expensive, and unnecessary for some use cases. For those use cases, a [new
  service ID collector](https://www.drupal.org/node/2472337) pattern has been
  added and the theme negotiator updated to use it. [See the change record for
  information about how to use the service ID
  collector](https://www.drupal.org/node/2598944) for improved performance.
* The maximum time in-progress forms are cached [is now
  customizable](https://www.drupal.org/node/1286154) rather than being limited
  to a default cache lifetime of 6 hours. Sites can decrease the lifetime to
  reduce cache footprint, or increase it if needed for a particular site's
  usecase. [See the change record to learn how to access this new
  setting](https://www.drupal.org/node/2886836).
* If there are no status messages, the corresponding rendering [is now
  skipped](https://www.drupal.org/node/2853509). On simple sites that use the
  Dynamic Page Cache (the default), this can result in a 10% improvement when
  there are no messages!
* [Optimized the early Drupal installer](https://www.drupal.org/node/2872611)
  to check whether any themes are installed first before invoking an
  unnecessary function, which improves Drupal install time measurably for both
  sites and automated tests.

### Developer experience improvements

* [Adopted Airbnb JavaScript style guide
  14.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2815077) as the new baseline set of coding
  standards for Drupal core and contributed modules. [See the change record for
  information about how to configure your project for
  eslint](https://www.drupal.org/node/2873849).
* Field type definitions can now [enforce the cardinality of the
  field](https://www.drupal.org/node/2403703). [See the change record for
  information about how to specify a cardinality via the
  annotation](https://www.drupal.org/node/2869873).
* [Added new methods](https://www.drupal.org/node/2869809) to make getting
  typed configuration entity representations easier. [See the change record for
  more information about how to invoke these
  methods](https://www.drupal.org/node/2877282).
* The `html_tag` render element now [supports nested render
  arrays](https://www.drupal.org/node/2694535), enabling the creation of
  dynamic SVGs. [See the change record for information about how you can use
  this in your theme](https://www.drupal.org/node/2887146).
* [Added more helpful errors](https://www.drupal.org/node/2705037) when CSS
  is not properly nested under an existing category in asset libraries.
* Also see the [change records for the 8.4.x
  branch](https://www.drupal.org/list-changes/drupal/published?keywords_description=&to_branch=8.4.x&version=&created_op=%3E%3D&created%5Bvalue%5D=&created%5Bmin%5D=&created%5Bmax%5D=)
  for other changes for developers.

### Automated testing improvements

* [PHPUnit has been updated from 4.8.28 to
  4.8.35](https://www.drupal.org/node/2850797) in order to incorporate a
  forward-compatibility layer for PHPUnit 4.8, which will be useful during a
  future migration to PHPUnit 5 or PHPUnit 6.
* Many former WebTestBase tests were converted to BrowserTestBase. [Track
  current progress](http://simpletest-countdown.org/).
* The default approach for testing deprecated code has changed to [require use
  of the Drupal core deprecation policy](https://www.drupal.org/node/2488860)
  (`@trigger_error()`) to mark code deprecated; otherwise a test error will
  be thrown. [See the change record for information about how to update
  `phpunit.xml` and how to test deprecated
  code](https://www.drupal.org/node/2811561).
* BrowserTestBase is [no longer dependent on traits from
  Simpletest](https://www.drupal.org/node/2803621). Backwards
  compatibility is preserved.
* [Resolved random test failures](https://www.drupal.org/node/2866056) due to
  ResourceTestBase's HTTP client timeout of 30 seconds.

### Third-party library updates

* [Drupal's Symfony dependency has been updated from Symfony 2.8 to Symfony
  3.2](https://www.drupal.org/node/2712647). This major version update is
  necessary because Symfony 2.8 support will end around the release of Drupal
  8.6.0 next year. See the change record for information about [Symfony 3
  backwards compatibility breaks that affected Drupal
  core](https://www.drupal.org/node/2743809). [Drupal 8 also requires Symfony
  3.2.8](https://www.drupal.org/node/2871253) because of a bug in Symfony
  3.2.7.
* [#2533498: Update jQuery to version 3](https://www.drupal.org/node/2533498).
  Now that jQuery 3.0 has been released, jQuery 2.x will only be receiving
  security updates, so Drupal 8.4.0 ships with this library update. jQuery 3
  features numerous improvements, including better error reporting. See the
  [jQuery Core 3.0 Upgrade Guide](https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/) for
  information on jQuery 3 backwards compatibility breaks that might affect the
  JavaScript code in your modules, themes, and sites.
* The zurb/joyride library (used by the Tour module) has been [updated to a
  development version higher than 2.1.0.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2898808)
  to resolve an upstream incompatibility with jQuery 3. We will update to
  Joyride 2.1.1 once it is available with the needed fix.
* [zendframework/zend-diactoros has been updated from 1.3.10 to 1.4.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2874817).
* [jQuery UI has been updated from 1.11.4 to 1.12.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2809427).
* [jQuery Once has been updated from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0](https://www.drupal.org/node/2899156).
* [CKEditor has been updated from 4.6.2 to 4.7.2](https://www.drupal.org/node/2904142).
* [asm89/stack-cors has been updated from 1.0 to 1.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2853201).
* [The minimum phpsec/prophecy requirement is now 1.4](https://www.drupal.org/node/2900800).
* [composer/installers has been updated from 1.2.0 to 1.4.0](https://www.drupal.org/node/2900112).
* [wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin has been updated from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2900112).
* [guzzlehttp/guzzle has been updated from 6.2.3 to 6.3.0](https://www.drupal.org/node/2900112).
* [mikey179/vfsstream has been updated from 1.6.4 to 1.6.5](https://www.drupal.org/node/2900112).
* [phpunit/phpunit has been updated from 4.8.35 to 4.8.36](https://www.drupal.org/node/2900112).
* [masterminds/html5 has been updated from 2.2.2 to 2.3.0](https://www.drupal.org/node/2909743).
* [symfony-cmf/routing has been udpated from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2909743).

### Experimental modules

#### Migrate ([beta stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#beta))

Migrate provides a general API for migrations. It will be considered completely
stable once all issues tagged [Migrate
critical](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&status%5B%5D=Open&version%5B%5D=8.x&issue_tags_op=%3D&issue_tags=Migrate+critical)
are resolved.

* This release includes numerous developer experience improvements for Migrate
  and Migrate Drupal, including [deprecating outdated references to
  "CCK"](https://www.drupal.org/node/2751897), [simplifying field type
  mapping](https://www.drupal.org/node/2896507), renaming several plugins to
  better capture their and many other API and documentation improvements.
  (Backwards compatibility is provided in each case Migrate is in beta.)
* Added the ability to [provide the source
  module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2569805) to migrations to help site
  owners review what data is being migrating, especially for cases where the
  source and destination module are not the same (for example if a new Drupal 8
  module replaces old functionality.


#### Migrate Drupal and Migrate Drupal UI ([alpha stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha))

Migrate Drupal module provides API support for Drupal-to-Drupal migrations, and
Migrate Drupal UI offers a simple user interface to run migrations from older
Drupal versions.

* This release adds [date](https://www.drupal.org/node/2566779) and
  [node reference](https://www.drupal.org/node/2814949) support for Drupal 6 to
  8 migrations.
* Core provides migrations for most Drupal 6 data and can be used for migrating
  Drupal 6 sites to Drupal 8, and the Drupal 6 to 8 migration path is nearing
  beta stability. Some gaps remain, such as for some internationalization data.
  ([Outstanding issues for the Drupal 6 to Drupal 8
  migration](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&status%5B%5D=1&status%5B%5D=13&status%5B%5D=8&status%5B%5D=14&status%5B%5D=15&status%5B%5D=4&issue_tags_op=%3D&issue_tags=migrate-d6-d8).)
* The Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration is incomplete but is suitable for
  developers who would like to help improve the migration and can be used to
  test upgrades especially for simple Drupal 7 sites. Most high-priority
  migrations are available. ([Outstanding issues for the Drupal 7 to Drupal 8
  migration](https://www.drupal.org/node/2456259).)
* Drush support for Migrate is currently only available in the
  [Drupal Upgrade](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_upgrade) contributed
  module. (See the [pull request to add support to
  Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/2140).)
* Conflicting text field processing settings [are now identified and
  logged](https://www.drupal.org/node/2842222) to avoid security or data
  integrity issues with the migration of plain and formatted text fields.
* Automatic redirects are now [added for translation node paths that are no
  longer valid](https://www.drupal.org/node/2850085) after migration has merged
  translations into a single node.
* A data integrity bug that resulted in [duplicate comment types and incorrect
  comment_entity_statistics](https://www.drupal.org/node/2853872) for node and
  forum comment migrations has been resolved.
* A bug that [stopped public files from being migrated from D6 to D8 if the
  user first selected Drupal 7 in the UI](https://www.drupal.org/node/2907233)
  has also been resolved.

#### Content Moderation ([beta stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#beta))

Content Moderation allows workflows from the Workflows module to be applied to
content. Content Moderation has beta stability in 8.4.0-alpha1, but may become
stable in time for 8.4.0! Notable improvements in this release:

* Workflow states are now [selected from a select list, rather than under a drop-button](https://www.drupal.org/node/2753717), which represents a significant
  usability improvement.
* Now that workflows can be applied to any revisionable entity type, Content
  Moderation [adds entity type checkboxes to the workflow form](https://www.drupal.org/node/2843083).
  This allows site administrators to configure which entity types should have
  the workflow at the same time as they configure the workflow itself, for a
  more intuitive user experience.
* Content Moderation now [prevents the deletion of workflows that are currently in use](https://www.drupal.org/node/2830740)
  to prevent fatal errors and data integrity problems.
* The confusing terminology of
  ["forward revisions" has been replaced with that of "pending revisions"](https://www.drupal.org/node/2890364).
  If your contributed module refers to revisions that are not yet published, it
  should use this new term.
* [The 'Latest revision' views filter has been rewritten to avoid relying on a
  custom {revision_tracker}](https://www.drupal.org/node/2865579), and that
  table has been removed from the database schema.

As per the experimental module process, there were some backwards-incompatible
changes since Drupal 8.3.x. Experimental modules do not offer a supported
upgrade path, but [an unofficial upgrade path is
available](https://www.drupal.org/node/2896630).

#### Field Layout ([alpha stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha))

This module provides the ability for site builders to rearrange fields on
content types, block types, etc. into new regions, for both the form and
display, on the same forms provided by the normal field user interface.  Field
Layout has had several bugfixes since 8.3.0, but no significant changes. See
the [entity display layout roadmap](https://www.drupal.org/node/2795833) for
the next steps for this module, which needs to become stable by 8.5.0 to remain
in Drupal core.

#### Settings Tray ([beta stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#beta))

The Settings Tray module allows configuring page elements such as blocks and
menus from the frontend of your site. Settings Tray has improved significantly
since Drupal 8.3.0, including numerous user interaction and accessibility
fixes, better compatibility with stable core modules like Quick Edit and
Contextual Links, added documentation, and [a CSS
reset](https://www.drupal.org/node/2826722) for better themer experience.

The module reached beta stability following completion of [moving the
off-canvas dialog renderer into a core
component](https://www.drupal.org/node/2784443), and [renaming the machine name
of the module to settings_tray](https://www.drupal.org/node/2803375), to match
its user-facing name. We hope to make Settings Tray stable by 8.5.0. To track
progress, see the ["outside in" roadmap issue](https://www.drupal.org/node/2762505).

#### Place Blocks ([alpha stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha))

This feature allows the user to place a block on any page and see the region
where it will be displayed, without having to navigate to a backend
administration form. [8.4.0-alpha1 was the deadline for Place Blocks to
stabilize](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#versions), but the module's
roadmap was not completed. Furthermore, the module is not intended as a
standalone feature and should instead be a built-in part of the Block system.
For these reasons, [Place Blocks module has been marked hidden in this
release](https://www.drupal.org/node/2898267) (it can still be enabled with
Drush). The Place Blocks module itself will be turned into an empty module in
Drupal 8.5.x, since ideally the core Block system will offer the same
functionality in 8.5.0 (though this depends on completion of a [core patch for
the feature](https://www.drupal.org/node/2739075).)

Drupal 8.3.0, 2017-04-05

      states from Content Moderation into a separate component for reuse by
      other modules implementing non-publishing workflows.
    * Added the Layout Discovery module (experimental) which provides an API for
      modules or themes to register layouts.
    * Added the Field Layout module (experimental) which provides the ability
      for site builders to rearrange fields on content types, block types, etc.
      into new regions, for both the form and display, on the same forms
      provided by the normal field user interface.

    * Advance notice: Internet Explore 9 and 10 will no longer supported from
      8.4.x, scheduled for October 2017. Microsoft has now ended support for
      these browsers. Drupal will still support Internet Explorer 11 and its
      replacement, Edge.
- Raised stability levels of experimental modules:
    * Updated the BigPipe module from beta to stable.
    * Updated the Migrate module from alpha to beta.
    * See https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#versions for more
      information about the stability levels of experimental modules.
- Improved authoring features:
    * Can now drag and drop images into image fields in Quick Edit mode.
    * Image fields are now limited to only accepting images, so that users on
      mobile clients are not offered a confusing and non-functional video
      upload option.
    * CKEditor now utilizes the AutoGrow plugin to better take advantage of
      larger screen sizes.
- Improved site building and administration:
    * Redesigned status report.
    * Standardized display of Views overview page to more closely match that of
      other administrative overview pages.
    * Views filter order now matches the table column order below in Content

      transitions.
    * Allow moderation of entity types without bundles, as long as they have
      revisions.
    * Publishes any entity type that implements EntityPublishedInterface, not
      just Nodes.
- Migration improvements (experimental):
    * Drupal 7 core node translations are now migrated to Drupal 8.

    * REST API now supports the registering of users.
    * Anonymous REST API performance increased by 60% by utilizing the internal
      page cache.
    * Improved the response bodies and status codes for requests with incorrect
      request headers or request bodies, in dozens of situations.
    * Massive overhaul of the test coverage.
    * 403 responses now return reason why access was denied.
    * Serialized values for Booleans and integers are now returned as the
      correct data type, rather than incorrectly typed as strings.
- Improved performance/scalability:
    * Optimized class loader detection made more generic to support class
      loaders other than ApcClassLoader.
    * ViewsData and Token info cache now use the default cache bin to prevent
      APCu memory from being filled too quickly.
    * Improve statistics performance by adding a swappable backend.
- Improved developer APIs:
    * Deprecated several routing services in favor of two more unified services.
    * Replaced the deprecated Symfony ExecutionContextInterface by subclassing
      from ConstraintValidator to prepare for an update to Symfony 3.
    * EntityPublishedInterface and EntityPublishedTrait have been added to give
      a generic publishing API, and are being used by Node and Comment entity
      types.
    * Added a collection label to EntityType. This is a plural uppercase label
      for a collection of entities - e.g. "Workflows".
- Changed coding standards:
    * Officially adopted short array syntax and updated all of core accordingly.
    * PHP CodeSniffer and Drupal Coder have been added as composer dev
      requirements, so they can be installed automatically with
      `composer install --dev` rather than requiring separate installation. (Do
      not use `composer install --dev` for production sites.)
    * Most global constants in Drupal 8 have been deprecated in favor of class
      constants. As a best practice, use appropriate class constants rather than
      global constants.
- Testing improvements:
    * Integrated PHPUnit verbose output in SimpleTest UI.
    * Improved backward compatibility with WebTestBase.
    * Improved backward compatibility between BrowserTestBase and WebTestBase.

    * In the internal page cache, 404 responses are now cached for a shorter
      time (1 hour by default), to consume less space.
    * Breadcrumbs are now cached by the parent of the path rather than the full
      path, for fewer cache entries and higher cache hit rates.
- Changed coding standards:
    * Local variables and parameters can now use camelCase.

    * Converted all kernel tests to the PHPUnit-based kernel test API.
    * Improved error reporting for all PHPUnit tests (including unit, kernel,
      browser, and JavaScript tests).

Drupal 8.1.0, 2016-04-20
------------------------
- Removed Composer-managed vendor from the git repository:
    * Drupal.org packager adds dependencies to zip and tar package. This can be
      used without any further steps.
    * When not using zip / tar files, e.g. when using a git clone, run composer
      install to get dependencies.

Drupal 7.0, 2011-01-05
----------------------
- Database:
    * Fully rewritten database layer using PHP 5's PDO abstraction layer.
    * Drupal now requires MySQL >= 5.0.15 or PostgreSQL >= 8.3.
    * Added query builders for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, and SELECT queries.
    * Support for primary/replica replication, transactions, multi-insert
      queries, and other features.
    * Added support for the SQLite database engine.
    * Default to InnoDB engine, rather than MyISAM, on MySQL when available.
      This offers increased scalability and data integrity.
- Security:
    * Protected cron.php -- cron will only run if the proper key is provided.
    * Implemented a pluggable password system and much stronger password hashes
      that are compatible with the Portable PHP password hashing framework.
    * Rate limited login attempts to prevent brute-force password guessing, and
      improved the flood control API to allow variable time windows and
      identifiers for limiting user access to resources.
    * Transformed the "Update status" module into the "Update manager" which
      can securely install or update modules and themes via a web interface.
- Usability:
    * Added contextual links (a.k.a. local tasks) to page elements, such as
      blocks, nodes, or comments, which allows to perform the most common tasks
      with a single click only.
    * Improved installer requirements check.
    * Improved support for integration of WYSIWYG editors.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for input format listings.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for language listing.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for poll options.
    * Provided descriptions and human-readable names for user permissions.
    * Removed comment controls for users.
    * Removed display order settings for comment module. Comment display
      order can now be customized using the Views module.
    * Removed the 'related terms' feature from taxonomy module since this can
      now be achieved with Field API.
    * Added additional features to the default installation profile, and
      implemented a "slimmed down" profile designed for developers.
    * Added a built-in, automated cron run feature, which is triggered by site
      visitors.
    * Added an administrator role which is assigned all permissions for
      installed modules automatically.
    * Image toolkits are now provided by modules (rather than requiring a
      manual file copy to the includes directory).
    * Added an edit tab to taxonomy term pages.
    * Redesigned password strength validator.
    * Redesigned the add content type screen.
    * Highlight duplicate URL aliases.
    * Renamed "input formats" to "text formats".
    * Moved text format permissions to the main permissions page.
    * Added configurable ability for users to cancel their own accounts.
    * Added "vertical tabs", a reusable interface component that features
      automatic summaries and increases usability.
    * Replaced fieldsets on node edit and add pages with vertical tabs.
- Performance:
    * Improved performance on uncached page views by loading multiple core
      objects in a single database query.
    * Improved performance for logged-in users by reducing queries for path
      alias lookups.
    * Improved support for HTTP proxies (including reverse proxies), allowing
      anonymous page views to be served entirely from the proxy.
- Documentation:
    * Hook API documentation now included in Drupal core.
- News aggregator:
    * Added OPML import functionality for RSS feeds.
    * Optionally, RSS feeds may be configured to not automatically generate feed blocks.
- Search:
    * Added support for language-aware searches.
- Aggregator:
    * Introduced architecture that allows pluggable parsers and processors for
      syndicating RSS and Atom feeds.
    * Added options to suspend updating specific feeds and never discard feeds
      items.
- Testing:
    * Added test framework and tests.
- Improved time zone support:
    * Drupal now uses PHP's time zone database when rendering dates in local
      time. Site-wide and user-configured time zone offsets have been converted
      to time zone names; for example, Africa/Abidjan.
    * In some cases the upgrade and install scripts do not choose the preferred
      site default time zone. The automatically-selected time zone can be
      corrected at admin/config/regional/settings.
    * If your site is being upgraded from Drupal 6 and you do not have the
      contributed date or event modules installed, user time zone settings will
      fallback to the system time zone and will have to be reconfigured by each user.
    * User-configured time zones now serve as the default time zone for PHP
      date/time functions.
- Filter system:
    * Revamped the filter API and text format storage.
    * Added support for default text formats to be assigned on a per-role basis.
    * Refactored the HTML corrector to take advantage of PHP 5 features.
- User system:
    * Added clean API functions for creating, loading, updating, and deleting
      user roles and permissions.
    * Refactored the "access rules" component of user module: The user module
      now provides a simple interface for blocking single IP addresses. The
      previous functionality in the user module for restricting certain email
      addresses and usernames is now available as a contributed module. Further,
      IP address range blocking is no longer supported and should be implemented
      at the operating system level.
    * Removed per-user themes: Contributed modules with similar functionality
      are available.
- OpenID:
    * Added support for Gmail and Google Apps for Domain identifiers. Users can
      now log in with their user@example.com identifier when example.com is
      powered by Google.
    * Made the OpenID module more pluggable.
- Added code registry:
    * Using the registry, modules declare their includable files via their .info file,
      allowing Drupal to lazy-load classes and interfaces as needed.
- Theme system:
    * Removed the Bluemarine, Chameleon and Pushbutton themes. These themes live
      on as contributed themes (https://www.drupal.org/project/bluemarine,
      https://www.drupal.org/project/chameleon and
      https://www.drupal.org/project/pushbutton).
    * Added Stark theme to make analyzing Drupal's default HTML and CSS easier.
    * Added Seven as the default administration theme.
    * Variable preprocessing of theme hooks prior to template rendering now goes
      through two phases: a 'preprocess' phase and a new 'process' phase. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Theme hooks implemented as functions (rather than as templates) can now
      also have preprocess (and process) functions. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Added Bartik as the default theme.
- File handling:
    * Files are now first class Drupal objects with file_load(), file_save(),
      and file_validate() functions and corresponding hooks.
    * The file_move(), file_copy() and file_delete() functions now operate on
      file objects and invoke file hooks so that modules are notified and can
      respond to changes.
    * For the occasions when only basic file manipulation are needed--such as
      uploading a site logo--that don't require the overhead of databases and
      hooks, the current unmanaged copy, move and delete operations have been
      preserved but renamed to file_unmanaged_*().
    * Rewrote file handling to use PHP stream wrappers to enable support for
      both public and private files and to support pluggable storage mechanisms
      and access to remote resources (for example, S3 storage or Flickr photos).
    * The mime_extension_mapping variable has been removed. Modules that need to
      alter the default MIME type extension mappings should implement
      hook_file_mimetype_mapping_alter().
    * Added the hook_file_url_alter() hook, which makes it possible to serve
      files from a CDN.
    * Added a field specifically for uploading files, previously provided by
      the contributed module FileField.
- Image handling:
    * Improved image handling, including better support for add-on image
      libraries.
    * Added API and interface for creating advanced image thumbnails.
    * Inclusion of additional effects such as rotate and desaturate.
    * Added a field specifically for uploading images, previously provided by
      the contributed module ImageField.
- Added aliased multi-site support:
    * Added support for mapping domain names to sites directories.
- Added RDF support:
    * Modules can declare RDF namespaces which are serialized in the <html> tag
      for RDFa support.
    * Modules can specify how their data structure maps to RDF.
    * Added support for RDFa export of nodes, comments, terms, users, etc. and
      their fields.
- Search engine optimization and web linking:
    * Added a rel="canonical" link on node and comment pages to prevent
      duplicate content indexing by search engines.
    * Added a default rel="shortlink" link on node and comment pages that
      advertises a short link as an alternative URL to third-party services.
    * Meta information is now alterable by all modules before rendering.
- Field API:
    * Custom data fields may be attached to nodes, users, comments and taxonomy
      terms.
    * Node bodies and teasers are now Field API fields instead of
      being a hard-coded property of node objects.
    * In addition, any other object type may register with Field API
      and allow custom data fields to be attached to itself.
    * Provides most of the features of the former Content Construction
      Kit (CCK) module.
    * Taxonomy terms are now Field API fields that can be added to any fieldable
      object.
- Installer:
    * Refactored the installer into an API that allows Drupal to be installed
      via a command line script.
- Page organization
    * Made the help text area a full featured region with blocks.
    * Site mission is replaced with the highlighted content block region and
      separate RSS feed description settings.
    * The footer message setting was removed in favor of custom blocks.
    * Made the main page content a block which can be moved and ordered
      with other blocks in the same region.
    * Blocks can now return structured arrays for later rendering just
      like page callbacks.
- Translation system
    * The translation system now supports message context (msgctxt).
    * Added support for translatable fields to Field API.
- JavaScript changes
    * Upgraded the core JavaScript library to jQuery version 1.4.4.
    * Upgraded the jQuery Forms library to 2.52.
    * Added jQuery UI 1.8.7, which allows improvements to Drupal's user
      experience.
- Better module version support
    * Modules now can specify which version of another module they depend on.
- Removed modules from core
    * The following modules have been removed from core, because contributed
      modules with similar functionality are available:
      * Blog API module
      * Ping module
      * Throttle module
- Improved node access control system.
    * All modules may now influence the access to a node at runtime, not just
      the module that defined a node.
    * Users may now be allowed to bypass node access restrictions without giving
      them complete access to the site.
    * Access control affects both published and unpublished nodes.
    * Numerous other improvements to the node access system.
- Actions system
    * Simplified definitions of actions and triggers.
    * Removed dependency on the combination of hooks and operations. Triggers
      now directly map to module hooks.

    * Added a queue API to process many or long-running tasks.
    * Added queue API support to cron API.
    * Added a locking framework to coordinate long-running operations across
      requests.

----------------------
- New, faster and better menu system.
- New watchdog as a hook functionality.
   * New hook_watchdog that can be implemented by any module to route log
     messages to various destinations.
   * Expands the severity levels from 3 (Error, Warning, Notice) to the 8
     levels defined in RFC 3164.

    * Story sections make the open submission more adaptive in that you can set individual post, dump and expiration thresholds for each section according to the story type and urgency level: stories in certain sections do not "expire" and might stay interesting and active as time passes by, whereas news-related stories are only considered "hot" over a short period of time.
- Multiple vhosts + multiple directories:
    * You can set up multiple Drupal sites on top of the same physical source tree either by using vhosts or sub-directories.

- Added "search infrastructure":
    * Improved search page and integrated search functionality in the administration pages.
- Added translation / localization / internationalization support:

- Added fine-grained user permission (or group) system:
    * Users can be granted access to specific administration sections. Example: a FAQ maintainer can be given access to maintain the FAQ and translators can be given access to the translation pages.
