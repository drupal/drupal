Drupal 7.0, 2011-01-05
----------------------
- Database:
    * Fully rewritten database layer using PHP 5's PDO abstraction layer.
    * Drupal now requires MySQL >= 5.0.15 or PostgreSQL >= 8.3.
    * Added query builders for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, and SELECT queries.
    * Support for primary/replica replication, transactions, multi-insert
      queries, and other features.
    * Added support for the SQLite database engine.
    * Default to InnoDB engine, rather than MyISAM, on MySQL when available.
      This offers increased scalability and data integrity.
- Security:
    * Protected cron.php -- cron will only run if the proper key is provided.
    * Implemented a pluggable password system and much stronger password hashes
      that are compatible with the Portable PHP password hashing framework.
    * Rate limited login attempts to prevent brute-force password guessing, and
      improved the flood control API to allow variable time windows and
      identifiers for limiting user access to resources.
    * Transformed the "Update status" module into the "Update manager" which
      can securely install or update modules and themes via a web interface.
- Usability:
    * Added contextual links (a.k.a. local tasks) to page elements, such as
      blocks, nodes, or comments, which allows to perform the most common tasks
      with a single click only.
    * Improved installer requirements check.
    * Improved support for integration of WYSIWYG editors.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for input format listings.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for language listing.
    * Implemented drag-and-drop positioning for poll options.
    * Provided descriptions and human-readable names for user permissions.
    * Removed comment controls for users.
    * Removed display order settings for comment module. Comment display
      order can now be customized using the Views module.
    * Removed the 'related terms' feature from taxonomy module since this can
      now be achieved with Field API.
    * Added additional features to the default installation profile, and
      implemented a "slimmed down" profile designed for developers.
    * Added a built-in, automated cron run feature, which is triggered by site
      visitors.
    * Added an administrator role which is assigned all permissions for
      installed modules automatically.
    * Image toolkits are now provided by modules (rather than requiring a
      manual file copy to the includes directory).
    * Added an edit tab to taxonomy term pages.
    * Redesigned password strength validator.
    * Redesigned the add content type screen.
    * Highlight duplicate URL aliases.
    * Renamed "input formats" to "text formats".
    * Moved text format permissions to the main permissions page.
    * Added configurable ability for users to cancel their own accounts.
    * Added "vertical tabs", a reusable interface component that features
      automatic summaries and increases usability.
    * Replaced fieldsets on node edit and add pages with vertical tabs.
- Performance:
    * Improved performance on uncached page views by loading multiple core
      objects in a single database query.
    * Improved performance for logged-in users by reducing queries for path
      alias lookups.
    * Improved support for HTTP proxies (including reverse proxies), allowing
      anonymous page views to be served entirely from the proxy.
- Documentation:
    * Hook API documentation now included in Drupal core.
- News aggregator:
    * Added OPML import functionality for RSS feeds.
    * Optionally, RSS feeds may be configured to not automatically generate feed blocks.
- Search:
    * Added support for language-aware searches.
- Aggregator:
    * Introduced architecture that allows pluggable parsers and processors for
      syndicating RSS and Atom feeds.
    * Added options to suspend updating specific feeds and never discard feeds
      items.
- Testing:
    * Added test framework and tests.
- Improved time zone support:
    * Drupal now uses PHP's time zone database when rendering dates in local
      time. Site-wide and user-configured time zone offsets have been converted
      to time zone names; for example, Africa/Abidjan.
    * In some cases the upgrade and install scripts do not choose the preferred
      site default time zone. The automatically-selected time zone can be
      corrected at admin/config/regional/settings.
    * If your site is being upgraded from Drupal 6 and you do not have the
      contributed date or event modules installed, user time zone settings will
      fallback to the system time zone and will have to be reconfigured by each user.
    * User-configured time zones now serve as the default time zone for PHP
      date/time functions.
- Filter system:
    * Revamped the filter API and text format storage.
    * Added support for default text formats to be assigned on a per-role basis.
    * Refactored the HTML corrector to take advantage of PHP 5 features.
- User system:
    * Added clean API functions for creating, loading, updating, and deleting
      user roles and permissions.
    * Refactored the "access rules" component of user module: The user module
      now provides a simple interface for blocking single IP addresses. The
      previous functionality in the user module for restricting certain email
      addresses and usernames is now available as a contributed module. Further,
      IP address range blocking is no longer supported and should be implemented
      at the operating system level.
    * Removed per-user themes: Contributed modules with similar functionality
      are available.
- OpenID:
    * Added support for Gmail and Google Apps for Domain identifiers. Users can
      now log in with their user@example.com identifier when example.com is
      powered by Google.
    * Made the OpenID module more pluggable.
- Added code registry:
    * Using the registry, modules declare their includable files via their .info file,
      allowing Drupal to lazy-load classes and interfaces as needed.
- Theme system:
    * Removed the Bluemarine, Chameleon and Pushbutton themes. These themes live
      on as contributed themes (https://www.drupal.org/project/bluemarine,
      https://www.drupal.org/project/chameleon and
      https://www.drupal.org/project/pushbutton).
    * Added Stark theme to make analyzing Drupal's default HTML and CSS easier.
    * Added Seven as the default administration theme.
    * Variable preprocessing of theme hooks prior to template rendering now goes
      through two phases: a 'preprocess' phase and a new 'process' phase. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Theme hooks implemented as functions (rather than as templates) can now
      also have preprocess (and process) functions. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Added Bartik as the default theme.
- File handling:
    * Files are now first class Drupal objects with file_load(), file_save(),
      and file_validate() functions and corresponding hooks.
    * The file_move(), file_copy() and file_delete() functions now operate on
      file objects and invoke file hooks so that modules are notified and can
      respond to changes.
    * For the occasions when only basic file manipulation are needed--such as
      uploading a site logo--that don't require the overhead of databases and
      hooks, the current unmanaged copy, move and delete operations have been

- Field API:
    * Custom data fields may be attached to nodes, users, comments and taxonomy
      terms.

    * Story sections make the open submission more adaptive in that you can set individual post, dump and expiration thresholds for each section according to the story type and urgency level: stories in certain sections do not "expire" and might stay interesting and active as time passes by, whereas news-related stories are only considered "hot" over a short period of time.
- Multiple vhosts + multiple directories:
    * You can set up multiple Drupal sites on top of the same physical source tree either by using vhosts or sub-directories.

- Added "search infrastructure":
    * Improved search page and integrated search functionality in the administration pages.
- Added translation / localization / internationalization support:

    * Users can be granted access to specific administration sections. Example: a FAQ maintainer can be given access to maintain the FAQ and translators can be given access to the translation pages.
