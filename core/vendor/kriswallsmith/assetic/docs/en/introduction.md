What is Assetic?
----------------

Assetic is an asset management framework for PHP 5.3. Assetic enables you to
use a variety of third party tools that will help bring order to your
application's Javascripts, stylesheets and images.

How Do I Use Assetic?
---------------------

There are two distinct approaches you can take when using Assetic:

 1. Build, dump and output assets in PHP files that you reference directly
    from your templates
 2. Defining assets in your templates ("on the fly") and use a loader to
    extract, dump and output them

The first approach is simpler, but the second, with all its moving parts,
offers more flexibility and opportunity for optimization.
