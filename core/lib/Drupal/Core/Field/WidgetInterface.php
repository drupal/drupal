   *
   * The BaseWidget methods will set the weight, field name and delta values for

   * formElement() method will be called as many times as needed.
   *
   * Other modules may alter the form element provided by this function using

   * hook_field_widget_WIDGET_TYPE_form_alter().
   *
   * The FAPI element callbacks (such as #process, #element_validate,

   * $field_definition passed to the widget's constructor. Therefore, if any
   * information is needed from that definition by those callbacks, the widget
   * implementing this method, or a hook_field_widget[_WIDGET_TYPE]_form_alter()
   * implementation, must extract the needed properties from the field
   * definition and set them as ad-hoc $element['#custom'] properties, for later

   * @param array $element
   *   A form element array containing basic properties for the widget:
   *   - #field_parents: The 'parents' space for the field in the form. Most
   *       widgets can simply overlook this property. This identifies the
   *       location where the field values are placed within
   *       $form_state['values'], and is used to access processing information
   *       for the field through the field_form_get_state() and
   *       field_form_set_state() functions.
   *   - #title: The sanitized element label for the field instance, ready for
   *     output.
   *   - #description: The sanitized element description for the field instance,
   *     ready for output.
   *   - #required: A Boolean indicating whether the element value is required;
   *     for required multiple value fields, only the first widget's values are
   *     required.
   *   - #delta: The order of this item in the array of subelements; see $delta
   *     above.
   * @param string $form
   *   The form structure where widgets are being attached to. This might be a
   *   full form structure, or a sub-element of a larger form.
   * @param string $form_state
   *   An associative array containing the current state of the form.
