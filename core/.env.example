# This is the URL that Drupal can be accessed by. You don't need an installed
# site here, just make sure you can at least access the installer screen. If you
# don't already have one running, e.g. Apache, you can use PHP's built-in web
# server by running the following command in your Drupal root folder:
# php -S localhost:8888 .ht.router.php
# DRUPAL_TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888
DRUPAL_TEST_BASE_URL=

# Tests need to be executed with a user in the same group as the web server
# user.
#DRUPAL_TEST_WEBSERVER_USER=www-data

# By default we use sqlite as database. Use
# mysql://username:password@localhost/databasename#table_prefix for mysql.

# Nightwatch generates output files. Use this to specify the location where these

# The path that Nightwatch searches for assumes the same directory structure as
# when you download Drupal core. If you have Drupal installed into a docroot
# folder, you can use the following folder structure to add integration tests
# for your project, outside of tests specifically for custom modules/themes/profiles.
#
# .
