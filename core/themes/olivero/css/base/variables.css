    These variables help authors apply widths and negative margins to break items out of
    the grid, while still conforming to the larger grid system.

    Note we cannot change the values of these custom properties within media queries,
    as they are processed by postcss/postcss-custom-properties (for IE11 compatibility),
    which does not support that functionality. Therefore, we need a separate custom
    property for each breakpoint. 😭
