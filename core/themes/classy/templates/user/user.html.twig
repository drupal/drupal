/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to present all user data.
 *
 * This template is used when viewing a registered user's page,
 * e.g., example.com/user/123. 123 being the user's ID.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - content: A list of content items. Use 'content' to print all content, or
 *   print a subset such as 'content.field_example'.
 * - Field variables: For each field attached to the user a corresponding
 *   variable is defined; e.g., account.field_example has a variable
 *   'field_example' defined. When needing to access a field's raw values,
 *   developers/themers are strongly encouraged to use these variables.
 *   Otherwise they will have to explicitly specify the desired field language,
 *   e.g. account.field_example.en, thus overriding any language negotiation
 *   rule that was previously applied.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the container element.
 *
