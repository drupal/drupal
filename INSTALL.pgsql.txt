INTRODUCTION
------------

This file describes how to create a PostgreSQL database for Drupal.

If you control your databases through a web-based control panel,
check its documentation, as the following instructions are for the
command line only.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
------------------------------

1. CREATE DATABASE USER

   This step is only necessary if you don't already have a user setup
   (e.g. by your host) or you want to create new user for use with Drupal
   only. The following command creates a new user named "username" and
   asks for a password for that user:

     createuser --pwprompt --encrypted --no-adduser --no-createdb username

   If everything works correctly, you'll see a "CREATE USER" notice.

2. CREATE THE DRUPAL DATABASE

   This step is only necessary if you don't already have a database
   setup (e.g. by your host) or you want to create new database for
   use with Drupal only. The following command creates a new database
   named "databasename", which is owned by previously created "username":

     createdb --encoding=UNICODE --owner=username databasename

   If everything works correctly, you'll see a "CREATE DATABASE" notice.
   Note that the database must be created with UTF-8 (Unicode) encoding.

3. LOAD THE DRUPAL DATABASE SCHEMA

   Once the database has been created, load the required tables into it:

     psql -q -f database/database.pgsql databasename username

   If everything works correctly, you won't see any messages.
