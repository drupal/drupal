Block displays will show up on your blocks administration page. Once a block display is created and saved, it can be enabled and positioned in your theme by visiting <strong>administer &gt;&gt; site building &gt;&gt; blocks</strong> and selecting it from the list.

Blocks <strong>do not</strong> accept arguments from any source; the only way to get arguments to a block is to provide defaults to it, possibly via the PHP Code default setting.

<ul>
<li>Edit the argument in question; you may want to override this argument if you have multiple displays using it.</li>
<li>Change the "Action to take if argument is not present" to "Provide default argument". This will bring up a new box called "Provide default argument options".</li>
<li>The most common default argument type used for blocks is Node from URL, where it attempts to determine if the URL refers to a node, for example if visiting 'node/1' or 'node/1/edit'. User ID from URL is also very common.</li>
<li>If you change the default argument type to 'PHP Code' (note: You must have permission to use PHP code on your site) you can enter PHP to define the argument needed. Simply return the argument.</li>
<li>If you are using a <strong>more link</strong> with a block, you must have a page display for that more link to attach to. The more link will not print if there is no place (no display) for it to link to.</li>
</ul>
