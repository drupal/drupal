# Submission rate:
#   defines the submission rate for the different types of content
#   submission.  It is supposed to stop malicious attempts to screw
#   with the database and to stop denial of service attacks.

#     '"comment" => 60' means that there is only one new comment
#     allowed from the same IP-address every 60 seconds.
#

                         "story"   => "300");   // 300 seconds = 5 minutes
#
# Submission size:
#  the maximum length (i.e. the maximum number of characters) a
#  story, a diary entry, or a comment is allowed to be.
#
