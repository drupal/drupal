The <strong>RSS</strong> output style is only available for <em>Feed</em> display types. It will display the view as an RSS feed, which is a specialized XML output. This output is not user visible, but can be parsed by feed readers for aggregation.

You may supply a description for the RSS feed; most feed readers will display this description along with the contents of the feed. You may also select to use the site's mission statement for the description.
