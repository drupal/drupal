A row style is an individual style to display only an individual record within a view. For example, a <strong>node</strong> type view would display one node per row; a <strong>user</strong> type view would display one user per row.

Some row styles use <em>fields</em> which means you select from the available fields to display; others do not; they are able to use the base type and create a display. Usually, row styles that do not use fields <em>produce less efficient (slower) views</em>, so bear this in mind when contemplating the performance of your site.
