The <strong>fields</strong> row style displays each field defined in the view, one after another. Each field defines its own output.

By default, each field is put in a &lt;div&gt; unless it is selected to be <em>inline</em>. If it is inline, it is put in a &lt;span&gt;. Two items in &lt;div&gt;s will be displayed one after another, with the second one below the first. Two items in &lt;span&gt;s will be displayed on the same line. One item in a &lt;span&gt; next to &lt;div&gt;s is the same as two items in &lt;div&gt;s. This means that for the <em>inline</em> setting to do anything, at least two consecutive items must be set inline.

You may define a separator which will be placed between each item. This separator may be html. You can use &amp;nbsp; to print blank space.
