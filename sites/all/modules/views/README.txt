Welcome to Views 2. Please see the advanced help for more information.

If you're having trouble installing this module, please ensure that your
tar program is not flattening the directory tree, truncating filenames
or losing files.

Installing Views:

Place the entirety of this directory in sites/all/modules/views

Navigate to administer >> build >> modules. Enable Views and Views UI.

If upgrading from Drupal 5 and Views 1, your views need to be
converted manually. See administer >> build >> modules >> views >> tools >> convert.

often used Views for you, this might save you some time.
