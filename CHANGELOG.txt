Drupal 3.0.0, 2001-09-15
------------------------
- major overhaul of the entire underlying design:
    * everything is based on nodes: nodes are a conceptual "black box" to couple and manage different types of content and that promotes reusing existing code, thus reducing the complexity and size of Drupal as well as improving long-term stability.
- rewrote submission/moderation queue and renamed it to queue.module.
- removed FAQ and documentation module and merged them into a "book module".
- removed ban module and integrated it into account.module as "access control":
    * access control is based on much more powerful regular expressions (regex) now rather than on MySQL pattern matching.
- rewrote watchdog and submission throttle:
    * improved watchdog messages and added watchdog filter.
- rewrote headline code and renamed it to import.module and export.module:
    * added various improvements, including a better parser, bundles and better control over individual feeds.
- rewrote section code and renamed it to meta.module:
    * supports unlimited amount of nested topics. Topics can be nested to create a multi-level hierarchy.
- rewrote configuration file resolving:
    * Drupal tries to locate a configuration file that matches your domain name or uses conf.php if the former failed. Note also that the configuration files got renamed from .conf to .php for security's sake on mal-configured Drupal sites.
- added caching support which makes Drupal extremely scalable.
- added access.module:
    * allows you to setup 'roles' (groups) and to bind a set of permissions to each group.
- added blog.module.
- added poll.module.
- added system.module:
    * moved most of the configuration options from hostname.conf to the new administration section.
    * added support for custom "filters".
- added statistics.module
- added moderate.module:
    * allows to assign users editorial/moderator rights to certain nodes or topics.
- added page.module:
    * allows creation of static (and dynamic) pages through the administration interface.
- added help.module:
    * groups all available module documentation on a single page.
- added forum.module:
    * added an integrated forum.
- added cvs.module and cvs-to-sql.pl:
    * allows to display and mail CVS log messages as daily digests.

    * allows collaborative handbook writing: primary used for Drupal documentation.
- removed cron.module and integrated it into conf.module.
- removed module.module as it was no longer needed.
- various updates:

    * introduced links/Drupal tags: [[link]]
    * added preview functionality when submitting new content (such as a story) from the administration pages.
    * made the administration section only show those links a user has access to.

        + added "access control" to allow/deny certain usernames/e-mail addresses/hostnames.

        + added theme "goofy".
- collaboratively revised and expanded the Drupal documentation.

Drupal 2.0.0, 2001-03-15
------------------------
- rewrote the comment/discussion code:
    * comment navigation should be less confusing now.
    * additional/alternative display and order methods have been added.
    * modules can be extended with a "comment system": modules can embed the existing comment system without having to write their own, duplicate comment system.
- added sections and section manager:
    * story sections can be maintained from the administration pages.
    * story sections make the open submission more adaptive in that you can set individual post, dump and expiration thresholds for each section according to the story type and urgency level: stories in certain sections do not "expire" and might stay interesting and active as time passes by, whereas news-related stories are only considered "hot" over a short period of time.
- multiple vhosts + multiple directories:
    * you can setup multiple Drupal sites on top of the same physical source tree either by using vhosts or sub-directories.
- added "user ratings" similar to SlashCode's Karma or Scoop's Mojo:
    * all rating logic is packed into a module to ease experimenting with different rating heuristics/algorithms.
- added "search infrastructure":
    * improved search page and integrated search functionality in the administration pages.
- added translation / localization / internationalization support:
    * because many people would love to see their website showing a lot less of English, and far more of their own language, Drupal provides a framework to setup a multi-lingual website or to overwrite the default English text in English.
- added fine-grained user permission (or group) system:
    * users can be granted access to specific administration sections. Example: a FAQ maintainer can be given access to maintain the FAQ and translators can be given access to the translation pages.
- added FAQ module
- changed the "open submission queue" into a (optional) module.
- various updates:
    * improved account module:
        + user accounts can be deleted.
        + added fine-grained permission support.
    * improved block module

        + diary entries can be deleted

        + improved parser to support more "generic" RDF/RSS/XML backend.
    * improved module module
    * improved watchdog module
    * improved database abstraction layer
    * improved themes:
        + W3C validation on a best effort basis
        + added theme "example" (alias "Stone Age")
    * added new scripts to directory "scripts"
    * added directory "misc"
