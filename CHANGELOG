drupal 1.xx, xx/xx/2001
-----------------------
- rewrote the comment/discussion code:
    * comment navigation should be less confusing now additional/alternative display and order methods have been added.
    * modules can be extended with a "comment system" as they can embed the existing comment code without having to write duplicate code.
- added section manager:
    * story sections can be maintained from the administration pages.
    * makes the open submission more adaptive in that you can set individual post, dump and expiration thresholds for each section according to the
      story type and urgency level: some section do not really "expire" and stay interesting and active as time passes by, whereas news-related stories are only considered "hot" over a short period of time.
- multiple vhosts + multiple directories:
    * you can setup multiple drupal sites on top of the same physical source tree either by using vhosts or sub-directories
- added "user ratings" similar to SlashCode's karma or Scoop's mojo.
- added "search infractructure":
    * improved search page and integrated search functionality in the administration pages.
- changed the "open submission queue" into an optional module
- various updates:
    * improved cron-module
    * improved module-module
- revised documentation
