drupal x.xx, xx/xx/xxxx
-----------------------
- major overhaul of the entire underlying design:
    * everything is based on nodes: nodes are a conceptual "black box" to couple and manage different types of content and that promotes reusing existing code, thus reducing the complexity and size of drupal as well as improving long-term stability.
    * introduced links/drupal tags: [[link]]
- rewrote submission/moderation queue:
    * renamed submission.module to moderation.module
    * updated submission forms
- removed FAQ and documentation module and merged them into a "book module":
    * allows collaborative book writing
- removed ban module and integrated it in account.module as "access control":
    * access control is based on much more powerful regular expressions (regex) now rather than on MySQL pattern matching.
- various updates:
    * added preview functionality when submitting new content (such as a story) from the administration pages.
    * made the administration section only show those links a user has access to.
    * improved account module:
        + added "acess control" to allow/deny certain usernames/e-mail addresses/hostnames
    * improved comment module
    * improved story module:
        + added preview functionality for administrators
        + made it possible to permanently delete stories
    * improved themes:
        + W3C validation on a best effort basis
        + added theme "goofy"
- revised documentation

drupal 2.00, 15/03/2001
-----------------------
- rewrote the comment/discussion code:
    * comment navigation should be less confusing now
    * additional/alternative display and order methods have been added.
    * modules can be extended with a "comment system": modules can embed the existing comment system without having to write their own, duplicate comment system.
- added sections and section manager:
    * story sections can be maintained from the administration pages.
    * story sections make the open submission more adaptive in that you can set individual post, dump and expiration thresholds for each section according to the story type and urgency level: stories in certain sections do not "expire" and might stay interesting and active as time passes by, whereas news-related stories are only considered "hot" over a short period of time.
- multiple vhosts + multiple directories:
    * you can setup multiple drupal sites on top of the same physical source tree either by using vhosts or sub-directories
- added "user ratings" similar to SlashCode's karma or Scoop's mojo:
    * all rating logic is packed into a module to ease experimenting with different rating heuristics/algorithms.
- added "search infrastructure":
    * improved search page and integrated search functionality in the administration pages.
- added translation / localization / internationalization support:
    * because many people would love to see their website showing a lot less of English, and far more of their own language, drupal provides a framework to setup a multi-lingual website or to overwrite the default English text in English.
- added fine-grained user permission (or group) system:
    * users can be granted access to specific administration sections.  Example: a FAQ maintainer can be given access to maintain the FAQ and translators can be given access to the translation pages.
- added FAQ module
- changed the "open submission queue" into a (optional) module
- various updates:
    * improved account module:
        + user accounts can be deleted
        + added fine-grained permission support
    * improved block module
    * improved cron module
    * improved diary module:
        + diary entries can be deleted
    * improved headline module:
        + improved parser to support more "generic" RDF/RSS/XML backend
    * improved module module
    * improved watchdog module
    * improved database abstraction layer
    * improved themes:
        + W3C validation on a best effort basis
        + added theme "example" (alas "Stone Age")
    * added new scripts to directory "scripts"
    * added directory "misc"
    * added CREDITS file
- revised documentation
