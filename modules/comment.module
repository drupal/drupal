Setting the weight heavier (positive numbers) will make the vote label appear at the bottom of the list. Lighter (a negative number) will push it to the top.

When comment moderation is enabled and the thresholds are created, users will find another comment control panel option for selecting their thresholds.

Consequently, you'll probably want to create more than one threshold to give users some flexibility in filtering comments.</p>";

      ** We want to use the standard pager, but threads would need every
      ** comment to build the thread structure, so we need to store some
      ** extra info.
      **
      ** We use a "thread" field to store this extra info. The basic idea
      ** is to store a value and to order by that value. The "thread" field
      ** keeps this data in a way which is easy to update and convenient
      ** to use.
      **
      ** A "thread" value starts at "1". If we add a child (A) to this
      ** comment, we assign it a "thread" = "1.1". A child of (A) will have
      ** "1.1.1". Next brother of (A) will get "1.2". Next brother of the
      ** parent of (A) will get "2" and so on.
      **
      ** First of all note that the thread field stores the depth of the
      ** comment: depth 0 will be "X", depth 1 "X.X", depth 2 "X.X.X", etc.
      **
      ** Now to get the ordering right, consider this example:
      **
      ** 1
      ** 1.1
      ** 1.1.1
      ** 1.2
      ** 2
      **
      ** If we "ORDER BY thread ASC" we get the above result, and this is
      ** the natural order sorted by time.  However, if we "ORDER BY thread
      ** DESC" we get:
      **
      ** 2
      ** 1.2
      ** 1.1.1
      ** 1.1
      ** 1
      **
      ** Clearly, this is not a natural way to see a thread, and users
      ** will get confused. The natural order to show a thread by time
      ** desc would be:
      **
      ** 2
      ** 1
      ** 1.2
      ** 1.1
      ** 1.1.1
      **
      ** which is what we already did before the standard pager patch. To
      ** achieve this we simply add a "/" at the end of each "thread" value.
      ** This way out thread fields will look like depicted below:
      **
      ** 1/
      ** 1.1/
      ** 1.1.1/
      ** 1.2/
      ** 2/
      **
      ** we add "/" since this char is, in ASCII, higher than every number,
      ** so if now we "ORDER BY thread DESC" we get the correct order.  Try
      ** it, it works ;).  However this would spoil the "ORDER BY thread ASC"
      ** Here, we do not need to consider the trailing "/" so we use a
