UPGRADING
---------

1. Backup your database and Drupal directory - especially your
   sites-directory which contains your configuration file and
   added modules and themes, any contributed modules
   in your modules-directory, and your files-directory which
   contains uploaded files.

   Note:  For a single site setup the configuration file is the
   "settings.php" file located at sites/default/settings.php.
   For multisite configuration the configuration file is
   located in a structure like the following:
    sites/default/settings.php
    sites/example.com/settings.php
    sites/sub.example.com/settings.php
    sites/sub.example.com.site3/settings.php
   More information on multisite configuration is located in
   the INSTALL.txt file.

2. Disable contributed modules and switch to a core theme
   (bluemarine or garland).

3. Log on as the user with user ID 1.  (User ID 1 is the first
   account created and the main administrator account.)  User
   ID 1 needs to be logged in so that you can access update.php
   file (step 8) which can only be run by user ID 1.  Do not
   close your browser until step 9 is complete.

4. Remove all of the old files and directories from the
   Drupal installation directory.

5. Unpack the new Drupal files and directories into the Drupal
   installation directory.

6. Copy the backed up files-directory and sites-directories to the
   Drupal installation directory. If the original .htaccess or
   robots.txt files have been modified, copy the backed up
   versions of these files to the installation directory
   directory as well.

7. Verify the new configuration file to make sure it has the
   latest and correct information.

8. (Optional) Re-install contributed modules.

   Note:  Make sure the version of a module matches your
   version of Drupal.  Modules from previous versions may
   not be compatible with the current version.  Check
   http://drupal.org/project/Modules for the version of a
   module to match your version of Drupal.

9. Run update.php by visiting http://www.example.com/update.php
   (replace www.example.com with your drupal installations domain
   name).  This step will update the database to the new Drupal
   installation.

   Note: If you are unable to access update.php as user ID 1
   do the following:

   - With a text editor find the update.php file on your system.
   It should be in the main Drupal directory that you installed
   all the files into.

   - There is a line near top of update.php that says
   $access_check = TRUE;. Change it to $access_check = FALSE;.

   - As soon as the script is done, you must change the update.php
   script back to its original form to $access_check = TRUE;.

Note: Upgrading sequentially is recommended, one release at a time.
It is possible to skip releases, but is not advised.
